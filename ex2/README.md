A:

## Question 2.3.2b

Q: In order to evaluate the Phong BRDF model, you need to find the angle between
the perfect specular reflective direction and the outgoing ray direction. How can you compute
this angle, without explicitly calculating the reflected direction, given the incoming direction
`wi` and the surface normal `n` in world coordinates?

A:
